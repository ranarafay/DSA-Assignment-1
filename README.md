Task is to design a polynomial calculator that can perform three basic operations on large polynomials: add, multiply, evaluate. Since number of terms in a polynomial can vary, we can borrow the idea of linked list to efficiently implement polynomials. Each polynomial must have the address of the first term and each term except the last term has the address of the next term.
